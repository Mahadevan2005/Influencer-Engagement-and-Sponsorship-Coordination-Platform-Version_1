This is my MAD-1 project Influencer Engagement and Sponsorship Coordination Platform that I did during May-July 2024 for my BS Degree in Indian Institute of Technology. It is a platform that connects the influencer 
and sponsor for marketing products and get monetary benefits for influencer. This app has the superuser as admin who has all the statistics about the app and has ability to flag inappropriate users and campaings.
